# The Solar System

The Solar System provides the user with insteresting facts about all of the planets. The user can navigate to their planet of choice and then select whether they'd like to learn more about that planet's surface, atmosphere, or orbit.

I've always had an interest in outer space so this project was a fun way to get more practice with using React Router while being able to learn some interesting facts about all of the planets in our Solar System. It also gave me a oppurtunity to present these facts in an aesthetically pleasing way through the use of CSS.
