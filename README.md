# The Solar System

I've always had an interest in outer space so this project was a fun way to get more practice with using React Router while being able 
to learn some interesting facts about all of the planets in our Solar System. It also gave me a oppurtunity to present these facts in
an aesthetically pleasing way through the use of CSS.
